            <p><i>"Mayor Jorge O. Elorza revealed a proposed five-year capital improvement plan Tuesday that calls for spending between $16 million and $34 million a year on repairs to sidewalks, sewers, bridges and other infrastructure improvement projects." – John Hill, <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20170117/elorza-plans-to-spend-121m-on-providence-infrastructure">Providence Journal</a> Jan. 2017<i>

            <p>The initial assignment was to <b>document any creative process and map the journey of a person navigating the process.</b> I tracked the task of "looking for parking," pitched it to the class the following week and formed a group to persue the project.</p>

            <p>Here are existing models that our app would leverage. <b>The parking app would function similarly to existing products and systems shown above. </b>My role was to compile survey questions that would help us better understand the people we were designing for to narrow our focus. I came up with a list of questions, while crowdsourcing from our class things that are both still in doubt, and that I think I was already sure about, before sending the survey out to the greater Providence community. Here are a few questions we considered moving forward: How can people get to their destination in the most efficient way? What are some ways we can allow people to make choices and decisions that are not just transactional? What are common patterns of choice and decision making? How can people use such patterns to automate their lives in a more effective way?</p>

            <p><b>We interviewed 15 Providence drivers and collected 32 survey responses from nonlocal drivers.</b> Here are some of our findings: Most people have had issues with unpaid and expired meters. People try to avoid paid parking where there is free parking.If people pay with card, they tend to pay for the estimated maximum time. People use street parking either infrequently or very frequently, with very few in-betweens. Finally, the most important factor when looking for street parking is low pricing and proximity of parking spot to their destination.<p>

            <p><b>The survey results allowed us to identify scenarios we need to take special care to prevent moving forward.</b> Some scenarios to keep in include: when a person tries to reserve a spot that is already taken, when they are new to an area and do not know where the paid and free parking spots are, when they cannot tell the difference between paid and free parking, when they have more than one car and wish to register all of them, when they browse parking spots and attractions before they start driving to their destination, when they have overdue payments, how s'park will charge back and forth between different cars, etc.

            <b>I averaged two personas based on our most common interview stories to hash out with the team in attempt to help everyone involved in designing and building better understand, relate to, and remember the end user throughout the product development process.</b> The journey maps we presented are of two Providence drivers who run into every likely friction point brought up in disussion. <br><b>Persona 1:</b> Kim is willing to pay for parking if the spot is close to her desination. <br><b>Persona 2: </b>Ron would rather park further to avoid paid parking, but needs to keep track of time zones and restricted areas. Both run into common issues that come up involving parking meters, color zones, and finding parking spots.

            <!-- <p>Post-research phase, our group came together to reevaluate product objectives and success metrics. <b> -->
            Given the wealth of navigation and parking apps out there, how will S'park stand out?</b> Our primary focus was to create a tool that helps people save time and become more aware of parking spaces, availability and hotspots near their desination.

            <p>As such, our app will achieve the following objectives by <b>providing real-time feedback on parking availability</b> in particular locations, <b>accurately displaying parking prices</b>, <b>merging existing hardware</b> (EZ-pass and parking meters) with our digital interface to syncronize overall payment experience, <b>enabling multiple payment methods and time extension</b>, and <b>encouraging traffic efficiency by adjusting parking prices based on parking availability</b>.

            <p>Going off of our information architecture, we mocked up screens of the key features we were going to include in the app. This is what we imagine the app to look like.</p>

            <p>Our group put together a finalized style sheet and allocated screens to work on. We chose a cool blue and purple as our primary colors. Blue for familiarity and reliabiliy and purple for something trendy and relativley new. 

            <p>Here is our prototype of the <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/MFUCiqbf1gj9vchqw3gDEG0C/INFORMATION-ARCHITECTURE-and-WIREFRAMES?scaling=contain" target="_blank">S'park app</a>, consisting of screens that encapsulates the primary features we designed for.

    <center><h4 id="" style="font-weight:bold;">Next Steps!</h4></center>
        <p>Our blue sky app concept focuses on solving common paid parking problems, aiming to help people spend less money and time arriving to point B. With each registered person's vehicle infomation, the next step for S'park is to establish <b>personalized parking recommendations based on the size of their car, parking preferences and learn such patterns.</b> The current payment flow closely follows the EZ pass model. In the future, the app would be connected to smart parking meters that detect every S'park card for length of time parked, fluctuating prices of spots based on demand, popularity, and availability, and processing payments. Dynamic price changes also opens possiblities of sustainability incentives for electric/energy efficient cars as well as shared car services. </p>
