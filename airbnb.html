            <h4 id="">UX redesign of <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/">Airbnb</a> completed as part of the Kleiner Perkins Fellowship application. Selected as a finalist in 2018. </h4>

            <p>Throughout the week, I interviewed over phone and surveyed 15 Airbnb users and hypothesized a few improvements for their web experience. Themes that came up during our conversations started repeating pretty quickly <b>but helped me imagine what the typical Airbnb customer looks like, why they use Airbnb, what keeps them coming back, and traveling priorities.</b> I interviewed 9 and 6 males ranging from 20-48 years old. Responses <a href= "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QowKwTQl5qvw1bWliQNEcwcsZzyod4l_JMko6_4Z3V0/edit?usp=sharing">here.</a></p>

        <center><h4 id="" style="font-weight:bold;">Homes, Experiences, Restaurants</h4></center>
            <p>I looked to three experiences in particular when considering ways to improve usability: homes, experiences, and restaurants. <b>The Airbnb website functions as a store but there is ample opportunity for the feed and individual listings to work together to faciliatate a more cohesive browsing experience.</b> The site is content- and filter-saturated, there is a lack of associative entry points from home feed to listings pages to Guidebooks and Wish Lists, and the grid layout could more effectively encourage integrated browsing between experiences and restaurants. </p>

            <b>I averaged two personas based on our most common interview stories to hash out with the team in attempt to help everyone involved in designing and building better understand, relate to, and remember the end user throughout the product development process.</b> The journey maps we presented are of two Providence drivers who run into every likely friction point brought up in disussion. <br><b>Persona 1:</b> Kim is willing to pay for parking if the spot is close to her desination. <br><b>Persona 2: </b>Ron would rather park further to avoid paid parking, but needs to keep track of time zones and restricted areas. Both run into common issues that come up involving parking meters, color zones, and finding parking spots.

            <p><center><h4 id="" style="font-weight:bold;">What are the opportunity areas?</h4></center>
            <p><b>One: Airbnb doesn't feel personal.</b> Airbnb provides experiences that people want to come back to. But the website is not enabling people to make discoveries through pure browsing. The company does an amazing job finessing their services in making people feel like they belong, but the site could do more to inspire people to eventually associate Airbnb with experiencing life a new ways and through new lenses.<p>

            <p><b>Two: Building your Wish List. </b>11/15 surveyed don't use Wish Lists regularly and 4/15 have never seen the Wish Lists page. If not for homes, this feature is important for collecting experience and restaurant ideas to discover and bring such ideas to life. There are so many event and trip planning apps with hotel packages, tripadvisor, IHG rewards, eventbrite, and local that the paradox of choice routinely comes to play. People do not bring their online interests to life or capitalize on the things most beneficial to their growth. Wish Lists and Guidebooks have the potential to become a community builder or strengthen online connnections between hosts and guests.

            <p><b>Three: People do not visit the Airbnb website unless they have a desintation in mind. Can we flip this around?</b> The individual listing pages on the website do not reflect an excitement that inspires people to go places. Potential improvements inlude larger photos, review highlights, multimedia and videos to turn pages into an interactive space that reflects the sense of being there in person.</p>

    <center><h4 id="" style="font-weight:bold;">Next Steps<br>Introducing... Airbnb Spaces</h4></center>
        <p><b>There is currently no centralized platform for people to find available open spaces for co-working or hosting activites that feel intimate and comfortable.</b> People use Airbnb to find a place to stay, but everyone should be able to easily book nice spaces for hosting.

        <p>Airbnb would gain profits from individual event organizer subscriptions and from selling package deals to local businesses and companies who wish to sponsor their events at local or global conference centers. The eventual goal is to allow hosts and event organizers of any scale to rent out available location properties to host, organize, and promote social activites. </p>
