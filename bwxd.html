                <h4 id="">I've worked on the organizing committee behind <a href="https://betterworldxdesign.com/">Better World by Design</a> for two committee cycles to plan the largest student-run design conference in nation.</h4>

                <p>Better World by Design is a student organization consisting of 22 Brown and RISD students who put on a three-day interdisciplinary design conference every Sepetember. We start planning nine months in advance, and organize multiple events throughout the year including workshops, speaker series, and design challenges to generate student engagement in design thinking and creative interdisciplinary practices. In 2017, I worked on the Community Engagement subcommittee, then transitioned to Public Relations. 

                <p>As a PR coordinator this year, I worked primarily on executing our conference themed social media campaigns, developing cross promotion partnerships with our <a href="assets/projects/bwxd/press-kit-2018.pdf">press kit</a>, as well as planning advertising strategies for events, talks, parties, and design workshops that the committee put on throughout the year.

                This year, we cross-promoted with <a href="https://www.gsd.harvard.edu/">Harvard Graduate School of Design</a>’s annual design conference, themed this year as <a href="https://influencexdesign.com/">InfluencexDesign</a>, and AIGA RI on their <a href="https://www.knowherdesigntalks.com/">KnowHER Design Talks</a> to celebrate inspiring female design professionals. We worked to improve our current PR practices and expand our professional network. Here are selected projects done throughout the semester. </p>

                <center><h4 id="" style="font-weight:bold;">KnowHer Design Talks</h4></center>
                <p><b>BWxD collaborated with AIGA Rhode Island for the second year to co-host one of their KnowHER Design Talks at Brown University's Granoff Center.</b> This series celebrates and highlights the inspiring female designers who make up our industry today. Every Thursday during Women's History Month in March, one female designer will give a presentation on her work and her experiences. We PR'd this event for three weeks, wrote captions and set up a posting schedule for the committee to publicize the event on their social media. <b>I also wrote PR transcripts for RISD & Brown's daily newsletter and our mailchimp that was sent out to our 5,000+ subscribers.</b>

                <b>We launched three campaigns this year that reached an average of 6,000+ organic hits, 1000+ page engaged visitors and 41,000+ total impressions </b>from Facebook and Instagram. <b>"Meet the committee"</b> introduced the 2018 subcommittees with our silly photos. <b>"Theme Launch"</b> reveals our conference theme where one letter of our theme was posted each day leading up to our launch party. Finally, <b>"Speaker Spotlights"</b> were released weekly during the summer to show off our lineup of speakers. Print materials were also distributed around campus in conjunction with our social media updates.

                <center><h4 id="" style="font-weight:bold;">Tensions Theme Launch</h4></center>
                <p>One of our largest social events is the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/616942871979230/">Theme Launch Party </a> to reveal the 2018 theme and get students excited for the September conference. This year, we have chosen the theme of Tensions as an opportunity to reflect upon recent social, political, environmental, and technological challenges and their implications for design practices. Tensions can be described as the state or condition resulting from opposing applied forces. This definition can be extended to refer to a strained relationship between conflicting ideas, entities, or people. 
                <p><b>The PR team wanted to broadcast our theme in a more memorable way. </b>As a new way to advertise the our conference theme, we came up with a sequence of acronymcs to define the word Tensions, listed below. One letter of our theme was released along with a short video each day during the week of our launch party.</p>
                <b>T - Together</b>: into companionship or close association.
                <br>
                <b>E - Evolve</b>: develop from a simple to a more complex, advanced form.
                <br>
                <b>N - Network</b>: a group or system of interconnected people or things.
                <br>
                <b>S - Solutions</b>: a means of solving a problem.
                <br>
                <b>I - Innovate</b>: to introduce as new, to effect a change in.
                <br>
                <b>O - Opportunity</b>: a condition favorable for attainment of a goal.
                <br>
                <b>N - Necessary</b>: required to be done, achieved, or present.
                <br>
                <b>S - Spearhead</b>: a leading element, force, or influence in an undertaking.

                <p><b>I initially came up with this idea as a way for conference volunteers and speakers to help advertise the conference and generate more interest from their personal network. </b>Every year, the committee changes their cover photos and shares the event on their personal facebook pages, but our 50-70 accepted volunteers and 500+ attendees have no way to broadcast their involvement. Profile photo frames would be one more inclusive way that volunteers, participants, presenters or BW alumni could use to show their participation.</p>

                <p>Better World is a conference people love to come back to because our content team works hard to secure an incredible lineup of speakers every year.</p>
                <p>As our confirmed speakers became finalized over the summer, we publicized their headshots with a short bio to be shared on our facebook and instagram pages. This was our longest campaign, where I posted consistenly over three months as the speakers contracts rolled in. The reach of our posts increased exponentially when we were getting closer to the conference date, and when we launched two rounds of flash ticket sales when everyone was back in Providence in September. The full lineup can now be found on our <a href="https://betterworldxdesign.com/conference_2018.html">website</a>.</p>
