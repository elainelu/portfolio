                <h4 id="">I've been on the <a href="https://betterworldxdesign.com/" target="_blank" >Better World by Design</a> organizing committee for two years to plan the largest student-run design conference in nation.</h4>

                <p>BWxD is an annual interdisciplinary design conference on College Hill put on by 22 Brown and RISD students. We begin planning 9 months in advance, stay connected via conference calls over the summer, and organize events throughout the year. In 2017, I worked on the <b>Community Engagement</b> team. In 2018, I led <b>Public Relations</b>. Throughout the year, I've helped organize sponsored design thinking workshops, speaker series, design challenges, and launch parties. 

                <p>As a PR coordinator, I  worked primarily on brainstorming and executing our social media campaigns. I communicated with stakeholders and developed new partnerships using our <a href="assets/projects/bwxd/press-kit-2018.pdf" target="_blank" >press kit</a>, including cross promotion opportunities, and advertising strategies for social events. Here are some of our most successful conference-themed campaign materials!

                This year, PR cross-promoted with <a href="https://www.gsd.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard GSD</a>, other RISD and Brown student organizations, and AIGA RI on their <a href="https://www.knowherdesigntalks.com/" target="_blank" >KnowHER Design Talks</a>. We improved our current PR practices and expanded our professional network. </p>

                <center><h4 id="" style="font-weight:bold;">KnowHer Design Talks</h4></center>
                <p><b>BWxD collaborated with AIGA Rhode Island for the second year to co-host one of their KnowHER Design Talks at Brown University's Granoff Center.</b> This series celebrates and highlights the inspiring female designers who make up our industry today. Every Thursday during Women's History Month in March, one female designer will give a presentation on her work and her experiences. This event was promoted for three weeks. 

                <p>I wrote captions and set up a posting schedule for the committee to publicize on their social media, wrote PR transcripts for our mailchimp and for RISD & Brown's newsletters that were sent out to 5,000+ subscribers.

                My team launched <b>3 social media campaigns</b> in 2018 that reached a total of <b>6,000+ organic hits, 1000+ page engaged visitors and 41,000+ total impressions </b>from Facebook and Instagram. "Meet the committee" introduced the 2018 subcommittees with our silly photos. "Theme Launch" reveals our conference theme where one letter of our theme was posted each day leading up to our launch party. "Speaker Spotlights" were released weekly during the summer to show off our lineup of speakers. Print materials were also distributed around campus in conjunction with our social media updates.

                <p>One of our largest social events is the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/616942871979230/" target="_blank" >Theme Launch Party</a> where the 2018 theme is revealed. This year, the committee has chosen the theme of Tensions as an opportunity to reflect upon recent social, political, environmental, and technological challenges and their implications for design practices. 

                <p>To broadcast our theme in a more memorable way, we created a sequence of acronyms that define the word Tensions. One letter with its accompanying animation was released each day leading up to the launch party. The following <b>graphics were made in collaboration with our graphics team</b>.</p>

                <b>T - Together</b>: into companionship or close association.

                <p>I initially conceived this idea with the intent for <b>volunteers and speakers to help advertise the conference in their personal networks. </b>Every year, only the committee changes their facebook cover photos and shares the event with their friends. But the 50-70 volunteers we accept each year and our 500+ attendees had no means of broadcasting their involvement until now.</p>

                <p>As our confirmed speakers became finalized over the summer, I shared their headshots with a short bio on the BW facebook and instagram pages. This campaign lasted over 3 months, and the reach of our posts increased significantly closer to the conference weekend.
