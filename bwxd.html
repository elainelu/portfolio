                <h4 id="">I've worked on the organizing committee behind <a href="https://betterworldxdesign.com/">Better World by Design</a> for two committee cycles to plan the largest student-run design conference in nation.</h4>

                <p>Better World by Design is a student organization consisting of 22 Brown and RISD students who put on a three-day interdisciplinary design conference every Sepetember. We start planning nine months in advance, and organize multiple events throughout the year including workshops, speaker series, and design challenges to generate student engagement with design thinking methodologies and practices. In 2017, I worked on the Community Engagement subcommittee, then transitioned to Public Relations. This year, I led the PR team and worked primarily on executing our "tensions" themed social media campaingns and developing advertising strategies for various events, talks, parties, and design workshops that the committee put on throughout the year.

                <b>We launched three campaigns this year. "Meet the committee" introduces the 2018 committee with our silly photos, "Theme Launch" reveals our conference theme, and "Speaker Spotlights" were released during the summer to present our speaker lineup.</b> These campaigns launched in conjunction with our BWxD website updates and all our social media channels. Print materials were also distributed around campus. During the campaign months, we have reached an average of 6,000+ organic hits, 1000+ page engaged visitors and 41,000+ total impressions from Facebook and Instagram.

                <p>One of our largest social events is the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/616942871979230/">Theme Launch Party </a> to reveal the 2018 theme and get students excited for the September conference. This year, we have chosen the theme of Tensions as an opportunity to reflect upon recent social, political, environmental, and technological challenges and their implications for design practices. Tensions can be described as the state or condition resulting from opposing applied forces. This definition can be extended to refer to a strained relationship between conflicting ideas, entities, or people. 
                <p><b>The PR team wanted to broadcast our theme in a more memorable way. </b>We brainstormed a sequence of acronymcs to represent the word Tensions, listed below. One letter of our theme was released along with a short video each day of the week leading up to our launch party.</p>
                T - Together: into companionship or close association.
                <br>
                E - Evolve: develop from a simple to a more complex, advanced form.
                <br>
                N - Network: a group or system of interconnected people or things.
                <br>
                S - Solutions: a means of solving a problem.
                <br>
                I - Innovate: to introduce as new, to effect a change in.
                <br>
                O - Opportunity: a condition favorable for attainment of a goal.
                <br>
                N - Necessary: required to be done, achieved, or present.
                <br>
                S - Spearhead: a leading element, force, or influence in an undertaking.

                <p><b>I initially came up with this idea as a way for conference volunteers and speakers to help advertise the conference and generate more interest from their friend groups. </b>The BWxD committee changes their cover photos and shares the confererence on their personal facebook pages every year, but volunteers and participants have no way of broadcasting their involvement. Profile photo frames are a more inclusive way that volunteers, participants, presenters or Better World alumni can show their excitement.</p> 
<!-- 
                Better World accepts about 50-70 volunteers every year and they receive a free pass to the conference and a special T-shirt, but have no way of expressing their participation online. -->
