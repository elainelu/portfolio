            <h4 id=""><a href="http://1to1english.co/">1on1English</a> is a WeChat page that connects and schedules chat sessions between Chinese students to native English tutors.</h4>
            <p style="font-size:15px">I spent my holiday season in Beijing, which means I was living off WeChat. During my time with the Product team at Uniware HQ, I worked with engineers and PMs on cleaning up 1on1english's current registration flow and researched a design spec for a future release of a UI framework!</p>

        <div class="wow fadeInUp parent grid-12 row clear vertical-align-middle">
        <div class="grid-12 text-block">
            <p style="font-size:15px">The goal of creating a product like this one is to put tools in the hands of teachers and students who will create their own value propositions based on it.Registered users can find each other to start conversations, manage personal payments, and schedule sessions that work for both parties, while using 1on1english as their main platform for connecting with people, managing statements, facilitating video chat sessions, and browsing content. 

            <h4 id="" style="font-weight:bold;">How can we better facilitate the lesson scheduling experience between students and teachers in different time zones?</h4>


            <p style="font-size:15px">In between team meetings, presenting in both English and Chinese, and a ton of user tests, I was able to investigate UI patterns across native Chinese applications and incorporate such patterns in my research. We mainly critiqued the WeChat and Taobao mobile apps, looking for design details, graphics, interactions and animations, as well as user behavior, and navigation patterns. The main screens we investigated are shown below.</p>

        <center><p><h2 id="" style="font-weight:bold;">Surfacing Activity</h4></p></center>
            <p style="font-size:15px">While I familiarized myself with the product, I noted initial impressions, reactions to the existing user experience, and questions. These notes quickly translated into a document detailing existing design conventions and patterns across the product, including comparative hypotheses of how people engage with a variety of features communicated differently through different app interfaces. <b>To test our intital hypotheses, we recorded testing sessions among those who use chinese apps regularly, those who use North American apps regularly, and those who use both through a VPN.</b></p>

            <p style="font-size:15px">We audited a wealth of apps with features most similar to the ones we were looking to incorporate with 1on1english, and moved forward to test with a selection of them. This included UX flows such as <b>social media sign in, profile settings, registration, payment portals, and browsing.</b> Here are a range of UI components that were most distincly different between the two categories of apps, yet familiar to people and great for usability across most tests.</p>
        </div></div>

        <p><img src="assets/projects/wechat/asset2.png" width="100%"/></center>

        <div class="wow fadeInUp parent grid-12 row clear vertical-align-middle">
        <div class="grid-12 text-block">
        <center><h4 id="" style="font-weight:bold;">Testing</h4></center>
            <p style="font-size:15px">We conducted tutor interviews. We interviewed students and experimented with test tutoring sessions and trial lessons. We wrote and edited lesson plans. We held in-office forums and test video chat sessions between an english tutor and student. We shared prototypes, observed lessons, recorded video chat sessions, and listened to their interactions. We also analyzed how people in the states interacted with the WeChat app and how people in China interacted with the same WeChat app and 1on1english extension, and converged on findings by drawing maps and user journeys based on observations and findings.</p>

            <p style="font-size:15px">Between testing, and participating in tutoring sessions, the problem became more clear. <b>We need to minimize on undesired missed lesson opportunities between different time zones, while allowing both parties some degree of scheduling choice.</b> 

            <p style="font-size:15px">Syncronizing people's schedules is always a challenge. In our case, student and tutors aren't directly communcating with one another before the student requests a tutor. Instead, they are using 1on1english to facilitate the relay between requesting a tutor and scheduling a time to meet. If we give tutors the ability to schedule timeslots, the time may not work with the student's schedule given the time difference. If we give students the ability to chose from the tutor's public calendar, the tutor won't feel like they were part of the agreement. But if we give either party too much flexibility, they're less likley to follow through in the beginning stages.

        <center><h4 id="" style="font-weight:bold;">Solution: Schedules Flexiblity</h4></center>
            <p style="font-size:15px">The solution was to construct a series of notification prompts<b> that searches the hours where both people are available, then pass on the best options for the tutor and student to select from.</b> Three options are first sent to the tutor, where they have the option to edit any of them, then pass their selection(s) to the student, who confirms with a final option. After the lesson is confirmed, it will be added to their schedules, lesson materials will be sent via email, and both the student and tutor will recieve each other's WeChat contact information for further communications.

        <p style="font-size:15px">
            Students can now schedule new lessons from their calendars. And tutors can add new availabities on their calendar. The hours where both students and tutors are available can be seen by students. All booked lessons will then be automatically added to your calendar. Reminder notifications will be sent accordingly. This eliminates a previous task screen where "scheduling lessons" and "calendar" tasks were separate and underutilized in engaging actionable results early on.
