        <h4 id="">I worked with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=16713667011">Alexa communications</a> design team in the Devices and Services Design Group (DDG). </h4>

        <p>The Alexa communications domain inclues: calling, messaging, drop in, contacts and announcements. The home screen for Echo devices is a place that presents light weight, glanceable information that may be relevant to the customer. Currently, the comms team has a single “presence” card on screened Echo devices that is tightly integrated with Drop in. <b>My 12 week summer project was to design a delightful way for comms to exist within the exiting framework of screened Echo devices.</b> The goal was not to change the exisiting home screen experience, but to find ways to inject Alexa communications into home to drive engagement and increase awareness for communications features.</p>

        <p>In my last week at Amazon, I presented six rounds of the final design concept to PMs, developers, design directors and our VP of design. The new feature <b>"Ask my friends" is easy to discover, engage and re-engage with, raises awareness and increases engagement for Alexa communications. It combines Alexa comms with Alexa's info domain, while driving engagement for Alexa messaging which currently has the least engagement of all comms features.</b> It shifts the way we talk to Alexa, from concrete requests to more abstract and casual utterances. Most importantly, "Ask my friends" elevates people over Alexa. When Alexa doesn't know the answer to your questions, she can redirect them to someone who might.

                <p><b>I spent my first three weeks at Amazon setting up meetings with researchers and the data scientists in the studio. </b>I asked for their feedback, insights on their findings, attended customer interviews and studies throughout the weeks and took note of any takeaways and painpoints. To revisit earlier assumptions, I also pulled up past research general for communications and Alexa's skills. What was most interesting to me is that customers have low awareness of Alexa comms, and the conversation ends whenever you ask Alexa anything and she doesn't know. My first nine weeks consisted of <b>Research, Ideation, and Concept Development.</b><br></p>

                <p>There is an approach called <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/innovatorsdna/2017/08/08/how-does-amazon-stay-at-day-one/#24ee23c87e4d">working backwards</a> that is used widely by product managers at Amazon. The idea is to work backwards from a customer need, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to engage customers onto it. Working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, but this approach is especially important when developing new products or features. For new initiatives, a PM typically starts by writing an internal PR announcing the finished product. 

                <p>Writing press releases are the summer project for Product Management interns. <b>Since I was brainstorming new features to engage customers with Alexa communications, I wrote a few light press releases around different ideas I had to ask questions, consider the unmet customer needs, and challenge early assumptions that would serve the greatest customer need.</b> My working docs were reviewed by my manager and mentor at multiple checkpoints.

                <p><b>Questions are the hook for communications: they are inherently lightweight, casual and allow people to become experts to share their knowlege. </b>After narrowing down on the concept of Q&A, the next step was to audit exiting services then go wide in wireframing again. I made flows for incoming and outgoing questions and answers, design an audience picker, consider ways to incorporate a messaging canvas as well as reciever and sender screens for all core and extended use cases for UX reviews. I added myself to the presenter list for bi-weekly UX reviews, pand scheduled 1:1 critiques with designers in my team and researchers in the studio.</p>

            UX Interns in the <a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en-gb/teams/ddg">Devices and Services Design Group</a> rarely ship, but my project that initially began as an open ended, high level design exploreation became increasingly tactile as we moved forward in the design process.
