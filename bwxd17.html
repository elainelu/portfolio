                <p>Each year, 1000+ attendess and 70+ presenters fly in from around the world. In my first year, I worked on Community Engagement then transitioned to PR the following year. As a CE coordinator, I helped facilitate workshops and discussions that engage in design thinking and arts education for our 10th aniversary conference. <!-- The lineup for our 10th aniversary conference included <a href="http://www.johnzelek.com/">John Zelek</a>, the Senior Creative at <a href="https://www.soylent.com/">Soylent</a>, Cynthia E. Smith, the <a href="https://www.cooperhewitt.org/">Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum</a>’s Curator of Socially Responsible Design, and the interdisciplinary artist, designer, and fellow at The <a href="https://urbandesignforum.org/">Kennedy Center and Urban Design Forum</a>, <a href="http://studioijeoma.com/">Ekene Ijeoma. </a> -->

                <br><b>Our theme for the 10th aniversary conference was Blocks, Bytes, and Bars. </b>We brainstormed and workshoped a wealth of ideas for over a month to arrive at these three symbols, which provide an alternative method of conceiving the design process. They can also represent design’s traditional past, technological present, and aspirational future. Symbolism, however, is inherently ambiguous and invites multiple interpretations. As such, we hoped that crafting the theme in this way will provide a fresh lens through which new stories, understandings and connections can emerge. </p>

We worked with CityArts, the Children's Museum, Providence High Schools, and were in communications with local organizations, artists, startups and other instituions for opportunities to collaborate. Here are some of our projects and successes.</p>

                <p>Here is a preview of our draft design challenge! This was created in partnership with <i>¡CityArts!</i> for conference participants to construct a 5-week Wintersession course based on the following promp: <b>How can we use design-thinking to engage youth in social justice topics?</b> The Community Engagement team wanted to launch a more locally-based challenge. The winning submission will receive prize money from our organization, and teaching experience by engaging with youth in the Providence community. 

                <p>Better World x Design celebrates interdicipinary collaboration between designers, educators, and people from all disciplines that practice design thinking, and our team was interested in how arts education can facilitate such messages in our community.</p>

                <p>To further explore the ways design can manifest in our community, we set up multiple meetings with CityArts, a locally based organization providing after school arts- and project-based learning, to create a design challenge for college students in New England. Other ideas we that were not fully realized due to our timeline included an end-of-year garage sale to promote sustainable practice, collaborative art installations with local artists, and a "paint the steps" public art project on RISD's campus.</p>
