            <h4 id="">When people use the <a href="https://moxtra.com/">Moxtra</a> web and mobile apps, how can we facilitate a more synchronous experience between both platforms?<p></h4>

                <p>My role at Moxtra was a cross between research and product design, where I worked primarily on three different aspects of the product: iconography, UI for the Moxtra file sharing drive, and onboarding animations. I experimented with motion graphics, wireframed a variety of solutions, defined goals, documented interviews and validated hypotheses. <b>By the end, we launched new icons and loading animations, including microinteractions on the iOS app, and tested our prototypes throughout the design development cycle.</b></p>

                <p>The Moxtra application is mobile-first but complementary web funcitonalities have been neglected in terms of visual design and usibility. I was tasked with defining ways to facilitate a more seredipidous experience for customers and developers who use both the web, and mobile apps. </p>

                <p>
                    <center><h4 id="" style="font-weight:bold;">Iconography</h4></center>
                <p>The style of the existing file sharing categorization icons were simple, friendly, rounded line drawings. But different sets of them are used on different devices with repetitive icons that served the same purpose. <b>We narrowed down from 40 variations and shipped a new set of 12 "category" icons, which were made by closely referencing and merging the styles of the previous ones.</b>

                <p>Now that we have the new icons, they were easily integrated as a dynamic bottom scroll bar for uploading media and text files to group chats. The bottom pop up bar takes over a small part of the screen to maximize retainment of content for the primary file library space. By tapping on "add more" you can also upload from platforms such as Google Drive, Dropbox, and Evernote. The information is meant to be visually concise with no added complexity. We also learned it follows expectations when people navigate to the files section to upload media.

<!-- 
                    Clicking "add more" on the bottom scroll bar connects you to platforms such as Google Drive, Dropbox, and Evernote. <b>This file upload format dedicates a seperate navigation tab for full screen space to add files and folders.</b> The dynamic bottom scroll The pattern we have now come to expect, courtesy of messaging apps like iMessage and Messenger, is a split text entry bottom bar. Icons to upload media, images, and stickers are on the right, and the text bar is on the left.  Think of it as a very simplifed google drive with a unique navigational heirarchy. -->

                <p><center><h4 id="" style="font-weight:bold;">Organizing Categories</h4></center>

                <p>Similar findability issues with navigating "categories" on the web application came up during our user testing and interview sessions. Most people clicked around to figure out how to upload and manage their files. Many people couldn't find the annotations tool for commenting on documents sent to them, but also expected more obvious ways to find, add, edit. and customize their folders. There was also some confusion with defining binders under categories.

                <p><b>With the icons we made above, I designed variations of a new file uploading "categories" page for easier file management and organization.</b> People liked seeing the status of their recent files and recently active people working on the files to feel updated on the team's status. Some wanted to see not just number of files in each category, but number of group members in them. Regardless, those who used this beta version created categories more quickly when using our default icons to customize and sort them. The "binders" text was replaced to resolve confusion around unfamiliar vocabulary when sorting files digitally.

                <p><center><h4 id="" style="font-weight:bold;">Document Review & Recording</h4></center>

                <p>One way Moxtra differentiates from professional communications is with <a href=" https://moxtra.com/embeddables/documark-sdk/">DocuMark</a>, an embeddible SDK that allows you to review documents and annotate them with graphics and voice while offline or together in a real-time audio & video call. You can record guided tours of your file annotations, track when documents are opened, the pages opened, and time spent between pages, and leverage this data to analyze any communications strategy. <b>But to facilitate a more engaging project collaboration experience, the way we keep track of team members' annotations and uploads needed to be visible.</b> I was part of the push to design an activites feed to not only track file changes, but show collaborators, which pages are opened, and recent commentary.

                <p>When users start recording their comments and notes verbally, the page transitions into editor mode, where the menu and activity feed becomes visible on mouse hover. A horizontal timeline-like navigation bottom menu contains all files within the folder can be pulled up from the bottom "thumbnails" tab. This way, anyone can easily review on multiple files during each session.</p>

                <center><h4 id="" style="font-weight:bold;">Launch Screen</h4></center>
                <p>I also animated svg graphics like this one in After Effects, CSS and Javascript. The loading animation adds value to UX by providing a first impression to the Moxtra brand. Animation buys time to load data in the background while preserving an experience that feels quick and responsive. For new customers, this kicks off a walkthrough of the app's different functions.

                <p>Before deciding to move forward with the one above, I put compiled this <a href="https://elainelu.github.io/animate/" a target="_blank">website</a> to document the animations I experiemented with before landing on the one above. The documentation can be found <a href="https://github.com/elainelu/animate" a target="_blank">here</a> on GitHub.

                <center><h4 id="" style="font-weight:bold;">Onboarding</h4></center>
                <p> I also helped design a new set of graphics for the app's walkthrough, to showcase the primary team collaboration features that Moxtra supports. The illustrations are stylistically inspired by Moxtra's own set of navigation icons. It extends the use of line drawings with no shadows, 1px icons, and 1 second bounce animations with clean transitions and that make the app feel a bit more fun and not totally flat.</p>
