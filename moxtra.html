            <h4 id="">When people use <a href="https://moxtra.com/">Moxtra</a> on mobile and web, how can we better facilitate collaboration between both platforms?<p></h4>

                <p>My role this summer was a cross between design research and product design. I experimented with motion graphics, ran geurilla tests, brainstormed a variety of solutions, wrote specs, defined goals, hypotheses, and success metrics. <b>We redesigned loading animations, microinteractions within the app, and conducted extensive research and testing with their web app.</b></p>

                <p>The product is mobile-first, but many mirroring web funcitonalities have been neglected in terms of usability. The messages portal is seperate from the developer portal, and for the last few years, it has been used mainly by developers for their open API/SDK. </p>

            <p><img src="assets/projects/moxtra/asset5.png" width="76%" style="float:left"/>
            <img src="assets/projects/moxtra/asset3.gif" width="22%" style="float:right" />
        
        <div class="wow fadeInUp parent grid-12 row clear vertical-align-middle">
        <div class="grid-12 text-block">
        
                <p><center><h4 id="" style="font-weight:bold;">Icons</h4></center>
                <p>(Left) Most of the existing icons consist of simple, friendly, rounded line drawings. But different sets of them are used on different devices, and variations of the same icons are nested within menus grids. We shipped a new set of "category" icons, which were made by closely referencing and merging the styles of their current atoms. <b>40+ variations of icons with the same functionaliy were narrowed down to 12.</b>

                <p>(Right) Uploading media and text files to group chats is conveyed with just a few elements on the screen. The information is visually concise, with no added complexity while leading people to make the default decision to tap on an item and add files. Clicking "add more" on the bottom scroll bar connects you to platforms such as Google Drive, Dropbox, and Evernote. <b>This file upload format dedicates a seperate navigation tab for full screen space to add files and folders.</b> The dynamic bottom scroll bar takes over a small part of the screen, maximizing retainment of content for the primary file library space. The pattern we have now come to expect, courtesy of messaging apps like iMessage and Messenger, is a split text entry bottom bar. Icons to upload media, images, and stickers are on the right, and the text bar is on the left.  Think of it as a very simplifed google drive with a unique navigational heirarchy.

                <p><center><h4 id="" style="font-weight:bold;">Explorations for Organizing Categories</h4></center>

                <p>Similar findability issues with navigating the "categories" section came up during guerilla tests, tree tests, and a few interviews. People clicked around to figure out how uploding files and managing files worked. Many expected more obvious ways to find, add and edit files. Some couldn't find the annotations tool to comment on documents sent to them. People wanted to customize their binders. People liked the default icons, and wanted to easily set and change them. There was general confusion with correlation and nesting between "binders" and "categories."

                <p><b>Using the icons we made above, I reorganized and redesigned the categories page based on our findings.</b> People liked seeing the status of their recent files and recently active coworkers, making them more involved with the team's status, and those who used this beta version created more categories using our default icons to customize and sort them. The "binders" text was replaced with "categories." As a result, confusion was gone and people now expect to add binders in categories, and files to either one of them. Some wanted to see not just number of files in each category, but number of group members in them.

                <p><center><h4 id="" style="font-weight:bold;">Recording Sessions & Activity Feed</h4></center>

                <p>One way Moxtra differentiates from business collaboration platforms is thorugh Moxtra Notes, where you can record guided tours of your annotations and add them to the chat stream. <b>In order to facilitate an engaging and collaborative project experience, the way that we keep track of team members' annotations and uploads needed to be visible.</b> I designed a dynamic activites feed that not only tracks file changes, but shows active collaborators, files, and comments.

                <p>A recording session transforms the page into night mode, where the Moxtra menu and activity feed becomes visible on mouse hover. A timeline of all files within the folder can be pulled up from the bottom "thumbnails" tab. This way, you easily can annotate on multiple files during each session.</p>

                <center><h4 id="" style="font-weight:bold;">Launch</h4></center>
                <p>I animated svg graphics like this one in After Effects, CSS and Javascript. The loading animation adds value to UX by providing a first impression to the Moxtra brand. <b>Animation also buys time to load data in the background while preserving an experience that feels quick and responsive.</b> For new users, this kicks off a walkthrough of the app's different functions. For returning users, it leads to the group messaging home screen.

                <p>Before deciding to move forward with the one above, I hacked together this <a href="https://elainelu.github.io/animate/" a target="_blank">website</a> to document the compilation of JS animations I experimented with. Find the documentation <a href="https://github.com/elainelu/animate" a target="_blank">here</a> on GitHub.

                <center><h4 id="" style="font-weight:bold;">Onboarding</h4></center>
                <p> I also helped make a new set of graphics for the app's walkthrough which allows people to imagine the multiple ways they can use this app. The illustrations are stylistically inspired by Moxtra's own set of navigation icons. As the app stands, it continues the use of no shadows, 1px icons, and 1 second bounce animations. The clean transitions and illustrations make the app feel animated and not totally flat.</p>
