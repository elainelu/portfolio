            <h4 id="">When people use the <a href="https://moxtra.com/" target="_blank" >Moxtra</a> web and mobile apps, how can we facilitate a more synchronous experience between both platforms?<p></h4>

                <p>My role for 10 weeks at Moxtra was a cross between research and product design. I worked on misc projects such as designing iconography, prototyping microinteractions, and drawing UI for file sharing screens. I defined goals, attended customer interviews, and made graphics for the web and ios apps. <b>By the end, we launched new icons, pages, and animations across the product.</b></p>

                <p>The business collaboration product is mobile-first, but complementary web funcitonalities have been neglected in visual design and usability. I was tasked to define ways to facilitate a more seredipidous experience for customers and developers who use the product on more than one platform. </p>

                <p>The style of the existing file sharing categorization icons were simple, friendly, rounded line drawings. But different sets of them are used on different devices with repetitive icons that served the same purpose. <b>We narrowed down from 40 variations and shipped a new set of 12 "category" icons, which were made by cosolidating the style of previous icons.</b>

                <p>The new icons were easily integrated as a dynamic bottom scroll bar for uploading media and text files to group chats. The bottom pop up menu takes over a small part of the screen to maximize retainment of content for the primary file library space. By tapping on "add more" you can also upload from platforms such as Google Drive, Dropbox, and Evernote. The information is meant to be visually clear with no added complexity. We also learned it follows expectations when people navigate to the files section to upload media.

                <p><center><h4 id="" style="font-weight:bold;">Organizing Categories</h4></center>

                <p>Similar findability issues with navigating "categories" on the web application came up during our user testing and interview sessions. Most people clicked around to figure out how to upload and manage their files. Many people couldn't find the annotations tool for commenting on documents sent to them, but also expected more obvious ways to find, add, edit. and customize their folders. There was also some confusion with defining binders under categories.

                <p><b>Using the new icons we designed, I iterated on a new file uploading page for easier file sorting and management.</b> From interviews, I learned that people like seeing the status of their recent files and collaborators because it makes them feel more in touch with the project's status. Some wanted to see not only the number of files in each category, but notes from active collaborators. Regardless, those who used this beta version created categories more quickly when using our default icons to customize and sort them. The "binders" text was replaced to resolve confusion around unfamiliar vocabulary when sorting files digitally.

                <p><center><h4 id="" style="font-weight:bold;">Document Review & Recording</h4></center>

                <p>One way Moxtra differentiates from professional communications is with <a href=" https://moxtra.com/embeddables/documark-sdk/" target="_blank" >DocuMark</a>, an embeddible SDK that allows you to review documents and annotate them with graphics and voice while offline or together in a real-time audio & video call. You can record guided tours of your file annotations, track when documents are opened, the pages opened, and time spent between pages, and leverage this data to analyze any communications strategy. 

                    <p><b>To facilitate a more engaging project collaboration experience, the way we keep track of collaborators' annotations and uploads needed to be visible.</b> I was part of the effort to design an activites feed that not only track file changes, but show collaborators, their comments, and which pages have been read.

                <p>When people start recording their comments and notes verbally, the page transitions into editor mode, where the menu and activity feed becomes visible on mouse hover. A horizontal timeline-like navigation bottom menu contains all files within the folder can be pulled up from the bottom "thumbnails" tab. This way, anyone can easily review on multiple files during each session.</p>

                <center><h4 id="" style="font-weight:bold;">Launch Screen</h4></center>
                <p>I also animated graphics like this one in After Effects, CSS and Javascript. Animation buys time to load data in the background while preserving an experience that feels quick and responsive. For new customers, this kicks off a walkthrough of the app's functions and establishes first impressions of the brand.

                <p>Before deciding to move forward with the one above, I put compiled this <a href="https://elainelu.github.io/animate/" a target="_blank">website</a> to document animations I experiemented with.

                <center><h4 id="" style="font-weight:bold;">Onboarding</h4></center>
                <p> I also helped design a new set of graphics for the app's walkthrough to showcase the primary capabilities of the product. The illustrations are stylistically inspired by Moxtra's navigation icons. It extends the use of line drawings with no shadows, 1px icons, and 1 second bounce animations with clean transitions and that make the app feel a bit more fun and not totally flat.</p>
