        <h4 id=""><a href="http://dilililabs.com/">Dilili Labs</a> is working on a multi-purpose robot platform that can be controlled by and monitored through android apps.</h4>

        <p>I spent my Summer mainly working on designing and building the Follow Me android application, and defining a design spec for the framework of the future applications for internal testing and demo purposes. Along the way, I worked with Android Studio, pushed code in Java, and created interactions, visuals, and presentation graphics.</p>
        

        <h4 id="" style="font-weight:bold;">How might we build tools to test existing programs and establish possible functionalities of the platform?</h4>

        <p>The most immediate issue is to create tool to perform the commands and execute existing programs on demand. We wanted to focus on developing an application to use for internal testing. At the same time, this tool will also show others how the robot works, and be able to demonstrate new features and functionalities.

        <center><h4 id="" style="font-weight:bold;">Users</h4></center>

        <p>I identified a few personas of our target users for whom the app would be useful to. These include individual contributers, engineers, and other tech companies.

        <center><h4 id="" style="font-weight:bold;">Wireframing</h4></center>

        <p>Our goal was to design a product that enables the robot to perform "follow me" where the robot lock down on the sensor-detected person within a five feet radius, then follow and record that persons path for future repetitions. The first step was to integrate our motion detection and cv algorithms with the Android app, allowing it to serve as a remote control.</p>

        <p>The video recording lens is now redirected thorugh the robot platform. With this in mind, I wanted to keep the activity screens as familiar as possible. This interface picture above is derived from the phone camera's video recording screen, with microinteractions and tweeks such as the progress loading and status bar at the top.

        <p>When you open the app, the welcome screen provides a brief description of what to expect when you begin recording paths, while providing time for data to load. Once a person stands within range of the video camera for it to recognize you, the robot will automatically lock down on the identified person. A pop up notification will ask you to confirm.

        <p><center><h4 id="" style="font-weight:bold;">Implementation</h4></center>
        <p>The feature I worked on implementing is video streaming and recording path data. The main features include sensor selection, video streaming and recording. We kept the recording interface consistent with the android camera and video screens, with the addition of robot activity and status report messages. Live video footage will stream to your device and be saved in your gallery. 

        <p>Having explored a few different directions, we converged on an interface that allows integration of all features the engineering team was currently working on, and with placeholders for features that were to be integrated in the future. This was a good option to immediately ship given our time frame to develop and demo the app, while allowing versitity for adding new features moving forward.

        <!-- <center><h4 id="" style="font-weight:bold;">Deliverables</h4></center> -->
        <p>I also worked on cleaning up a robot diagnostics tool and remote control that generates status reports, controls speed and direction. This testing application was intially used in conjunction with "follow me" to establish a connection between our software and the robot.
